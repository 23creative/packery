### All bug reports and problem issues require a reduced test case

All bug reports and problem issues require a reduced test case. [See CSS Tricks - Reduced Test Cases on why they "are the absolute, ... number one way to troubleshoot bugs."](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/)

+ A reduced test case is an isolated example that demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains no extra functionality or styling than what is required to demonstrate the bug.
+ Please fork any one of the CodePen examples in the docs and use that to build your reduced test case.
+ A link to your site is **not** a reduced test case.
+ Until you provide a reduced test case, your issue will be closed.

I realize this guideline may seem a little harsh, but it dramatically helps both of you and me. Reduced test cases help you understand your own software and identify the issue at hand. On my side, they greatly reduce the amount of time spent resolving the issue.
